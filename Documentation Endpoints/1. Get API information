# GET API INFORMATION ( GET -/ )

# Description

This is the root endpoint of the entire API, and its objective is basically to give a summary basic information of the API itself in json format using as a means to extract some data from cave ```package.json``` through ```ES6 imports``` as you can see in these lines within ```./src/api/index.js``` like this:
```
import { createRequire } from 'module';
const reqr = createRequire(import.meta.url);
const packageConfig = reqr('../../package.json');
```
and set up within express method ```router.get('/', (req, res) =>{}``` in the same file.

# Response

In this endpoint ```localhost:3000/``` you will get the summarized api info in json format.
```
{
    name: "DevLand API",
    apiVersion: 1.0.0,
    repository: {"type": "git", "url": "git+https://github.com/DevLand-Network/devland-backend.git"},
    description: "DevLand Main Backend Repo",
    license: "MIT",
    licenseUrl: packageConfig.licenseUrl,
  }
```

# Routing process

MAIN INDEX



```File: index.js```

In this file you will find the import (ES6) of the path like this
```
import api from './src/api/index.js';
```

and the use middleware method ```app.use()``` like this
```
app.use(api);
app.use('/api', api);
app.use('/api/v1', api);
```

In this way yo can see how is bringing the modules thata was exported throught the defaul export as you can see in the file ```'./src/api/index.js';``` in this way
```
export default router;
```

In this same file ```'./src/api/index.js';``` you will can find the Router mini app method whit the endpoint ```"/"``` and their respective callback that redirects to api docs or send api info like this

```
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    name: packageConfig.name,
    apiVersion: packageConfig.version,
    repository: packageConfig.repository,
    description: packageConfig.description,
    license: packageConfig.license,
    licenseUrl: packageConfig.licenseUrl,
  });
});
```
